# Solar-System-Calculator

Run simulations for interplanetary travel across the local solar system. Using gravity, time and speed for calculations of mass, force, age, distance and travel time. Option to run the full simulation or perform individual calculations.

Astronaut calculations:
- age
- mass
- jump height

Spacecraft calculations:
- distance
- speed
- time
